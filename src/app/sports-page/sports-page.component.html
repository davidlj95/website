  <h1>👟 Sports</h1>
  <p>
    Physical activity is crucial for a healthy lifestyle. Sports are fun (some
    are subjectively more than others 😜). So:

  <p>
    Sports keep you healthy whilst having fun. Isn't that awesome? Here are the
    ones I play.
  </p>
  <p>Come on, let's play a padel match, or go running together! 🏃</p>
  <h2>🎾 Padel</h2>
  <p>It's the sport I play the most lately. Twice or three times a week.</p>
  <p>
    It's like tennis, but
    <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padel"
      >typically played in doubles on a smaller enclosed court</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not confuse with

  <h2>🏃 Running</h2>
  <p>Started on summer 2023 as a way to do some cardio ❤️</p>
  <p>
    Better than running on a gym's treadmill: I'm under a roof most of the day
    🧑‍💻 So it's a healthy way to get some sunlight ☀️
  </p>
  <p>Plus I challenge myself 💪 Whilst being quite cheap 🤑</p>

  <h2>🎾 Tennis</h2>
  <p>
    Used to play it when I was a kid. 6+ years training every week. Some
    competitions
  </p>
  <p>Haven't played for many years. But that can change...</p>

  <h2>🏊 Swimming</h2>
  <p>Spent many years swimming as a school's extracurricular activity</p>
  <p>But don't fancy it much 🤷</p>
  <p>
    Nowadays I prefer a bathing in a swimming pool, hot tube or in the sea 🌊😌
    🍹
