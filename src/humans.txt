You may wonder: why this thing is here? Well was reading about "robots.txt" in Wikipedia when building this site and
found about "humans.txt" in the article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt#Alternatives

Saw that Google had one (https://google.com/humans.txt). And I wanted one for my site too :P
