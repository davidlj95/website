Hi, I'm {{ realName }}. Also known as {{ nickname }} in the cyberspace. I happen to be the author of my own site too.
Would you have guessed that? Well if you knew I'm a software engineer, maybe you did! Some things about me:

{% for descriptionLine in descriptionLines %}* {{ descriptionLine.emoji }} {{ descriptionLine.text }}
{% endfor %}
Visit the website for more info!

You may wonder: why this thing is here? Well was reading about "robots.txt" in Wikipedia when building this site and
found about "humans.txt" in the article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt#Alternatives

Saw that Google had one (https://google.com/humans.txt). And I wanted one for my site too :P

More info about the file in https://humanstxt.org/
