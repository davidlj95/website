Hi, I'm {{ realName }}. Also known as {{ nickname }} in the cyberspace. I happen to be the author of my own site too.
Would you have guessed that? Well if you knew I'm a software engineer, maybe you did! Some things about me:

{% liquid
for line in descriptionLines
  if forloop.first
    echo '┌'
  elsif forloop.last
    echo '└'
  else
    echo '├'
  endif
  echo ' ' | append: line.data.text | append: '\n'
  for subline in line.children
    echo '│ '
    unless forloop.last
      echo '├'
    else
      echo '└'
    endunless
    echo ' ' | append: subline.data.text | append: '\n'
    assign last_subline = forloop.last
    for subsubline in subline.children
      echo '│ '
      if last_subline
        echo ' '
      else
        echo '│'
      endif
      echo ' '
      unless forloop.last
        echo '├'
      else
        echo '└'
      endunless
      echo ' ' | append: subsubline.data.text | append: '\n'
    endfor
  endfor
endfor
%}

You may wonder: why this thing is here? Well was reading about "robots.txt" in Wikipedia when building this site and
found about "humans.txt" in the article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt#Alternatives

Saw that Google had one (https://google.com/humans.txt). And I wanted one for my site too :P
