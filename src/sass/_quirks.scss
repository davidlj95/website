// Just in Google Chrome. Maybe an optimization issue.
// Happens when:
//  - Main wrapper `div` has a left/right border
//  - Position of a child element is sticky. Like `app-section-title`.
//  - Main wrapper `div` is centered.
// More mysteriously, the border appears when opening DevTools.
// Can't be reproduced on Mozilla Firefox.
