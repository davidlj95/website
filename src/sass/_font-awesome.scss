// When JavaScript is disabled and page is pre-rendered with SSR Font Awesome icons seemed to be there in the DOM,
// but without their size set.
//
// Seems size is set dynamically by Font Awesome library. With this trick, we make icons always appear by setting its
// size. Which also helps with SSR, given there are less layout shifts. As it appears there from early beginning, not
// until its size is dynamically set
@mixin iconsStaticSizeFix {
  svg.svg-inline--fa {
    /* Otherwise, doesn't display when JavaScript is disabled */
    height: 100%;
