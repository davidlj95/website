This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Autogenerated files from templates

Some metadata about the app (like title, author, theme color...) was repeated across files. So used
[LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) to create template files (`.liquid` extension). Then, created a small script to render
templates into generated files using metadata defined in `metadata.ts` file (and some hardcoded constants in the
generation script)

If you update some metadata in that file, run the script to update files generated from templates. Otherwise, they
won't be in sync.

> Automatically updating generated files is not straightforward. Doing something before/after an Angular app build
> runs is [not an option right now][angular-build-hooks-issue]. Adding a bunch of
> [pre `npm` run scripts][npm-pre-post-scripts] left the `package.json` file quite cluttered. Also, won't work if
> issuing `ng` commands. So decided to leave the task to update generated files to the developer. At some point a CI
> check could be introduced to ensure generated files are up-to-date. Generated files are left in the repo because of
> that reason (also so you can clone & run without issues). That metadata won't change often anyway.

## Quirks

### Symlinked static assets don't work when serving locally

When using Angular's development server (either regular or SSR one), symbolic links seem not to work for static assets.
So for instance `/profile.jpg` which is symlinked to `/assets/img/og.jpg` won't be served. And the server will redirect
you towards main page (`/`). It works when building though, so it will appear in the built version.
